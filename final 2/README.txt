Keys for user interaction with the model:

Window Interaction Keys:
 esc = exit
 0 = reset view angle
 Arrow keys to rotate the view angle

The lighting interaction was taken from ex13:
 l          Toggles lighting
 a/A        Decrease/increase ambient light
 d/D        Decrease/increase diffuse light
 s/S        Decrease/increase specular light
 e/E        Decrease/increase emitted light
 n/N        Decrease/increase shininess
 m          Toggles light movement
 []         Lower/rise light

I have spent about 29 hours on the project.

I am really happy with the construction of the lodge and the trees. I also think I got my lighting working better than I had in the last few homeworks of the semester. I think the scene looks realistic as to how a ski lodge would look.
