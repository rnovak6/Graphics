Keys for user interaction with The Lorenz model:

Window Interaction Keys:
 esc = exit
 0 = reset view angle
 Arrow keys to rotate the view angle
 
 Line Color Interaction Keys:
 1 = light blue     color(0,1,1)
 2 = yellow         color(1,1,0)
 3 = purple         color(1,0,1)
 4 = red            color(1,0,0)
 5 = green          color(0,1,0)
 6 = dark blue      color(0,0,1)
 
 Lorenz Variables Interaction Keys:
 i = r+1
 d = r-1
 a = s+1
 b = s-1
 j = b+0.2
 f = b-0.2
 r = reset Lorenz variables to initial values

This assignment took around 10 hours of work for me to get it working well.
