Keys for user interaction with the 3D scene model:

Window Interaction Keys:
 esc = exit
 0 = reset view angle
 Arrow keys to rotate the view angle

The lighting interaction was taken from ex13:
 l          Toggles lighting
 a/A        Decrease/increase ambient light
 d/D        Decrease/increase diffuse light
 s/S        Decrease/increase specular light
 e/E        Decrease/increase emitted light
 n/N        Decrease/increase shininess
 m          Toggles light movement
 []         Lower/rise light

This assignment took around 6 hours of work for me to get it working well. The normals took some time to figure out how to calculate and get pointing in the right direction for correct light interaction. 

It took another 3 hours to add the large house with smaller houses surrounding it and to get the normals on the slanted surfaces working correctly.
