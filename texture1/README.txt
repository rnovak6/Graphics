Keys for user interaction with the model:

Window Interaction Keys:
 esc = exit
 0 = reset view angle
 Arrow keys to rotate the view angle

The lighting interaction was taken from ex13:
 l          Toggles lighting
 a/A        Decrease/increase ambient light
 d/D        Decrease/increase diffuse light
 s/S        Decrease/increase specular light
 e/E        Decrease/increase emitted light
 n/N        Decrease/increase shininess
 m          Toggles light movement
 []         Lower/rise light

This assignment took around 14 hours of work for me to get it working well. Binding the textures took some time to figure out how to bind the correct direction. I was having trouble getting the executable to run until I ran ./hw6 in the terminal instead of opening through documents. I used ex15, ex18, and ex19 to help determine the correct way to enable and bind textures.
